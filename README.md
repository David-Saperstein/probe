# Welcome to Probe!
It's an nmap-like tool written in rust.
At first I plan on reproducing the essential behaviors of nmap.
Then I'll focus on adding new features aimed at red-teamers and network testers.

At this point the project is far from stable, but feel free to play around with what's here until then.

Thanks!
